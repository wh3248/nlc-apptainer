These are scenarios:
    1. Build SMFS in the container and create .sif
       Successfully create .sif. Run container .sif file to get shell
       make install
       
       This fails because the install tries to modify the code in the build directory and does not have rights.

    2. Build SMFS and run "make install" in the container
       This fails to build a .sif file because the make install find missing files in the build directory
    
    3. I can install hdf5-openmpi, but not hdf4-openmpi because it says HDF4 is old and deprecated and will not install.

    4. Build all SMFS prerequisites in the container and create .sif
       Successfully creat .sif 
       From linux outside of container shell
       Get the source code of SMFS using:
            
            wget https://github.com/esmf-org/esmf/archive/refs/tags/v8.9.0.zip"
            unzip v8.9.0.zip
            mv esmf-8.9.0 $ESMF_DIR
            rm v8.9.0.zip
            cd $ESMF_DIR
       Run container .sf to create shell

            mkdir -p $ESMF_MODDIR
            cp /usr/lib64/gfortran/modules/netcdf*.mod $ESMF_MODDIR
            cd $ESMF_DIR
            gmake info &>log.info
            gmake &> log.make
